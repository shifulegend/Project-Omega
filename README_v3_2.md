## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_API_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Flask Configuration
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

# Database Paths
DATABASE_PATH=chat_sessions.db
LEARNINGS_DATABASE_PATH=ai_learnings.db
TUNNELS_DATABASE_PATH=tunnel_providers.db
```

### Custom Model Configuration
Models are dynamically loaded from Ollama, but fallbacks are available if the API is unreachable.
